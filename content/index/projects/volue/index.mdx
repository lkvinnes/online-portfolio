As Head of Design at Volue, one of my main priorities is establishing a healthy, curious, and creative team culture. A culture where we can grow as a team and as individuals.

In addition to leading and growing the design team, I am also part of setting the direction for design, product development, and realizing alignment across <a href="https://www.volue.com/products" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>Volue's rapidly growing portfolio.</Underlining></a>

During my first years in Volue, my main focus was the Water & Community portfolio. Where we deliver digitalization solutions that provide vital information to manage the water and wastewater networks. <a href="https://www.volue.com/news/norway-solves-water-industry-big-problems-data" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>85% of the Norwegian water industry</Underlining></a> uses and relies on these solutions.
